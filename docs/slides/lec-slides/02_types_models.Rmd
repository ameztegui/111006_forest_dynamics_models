# What is a model?

## model (noun) 
.left[.footnote[Source: Cambridge Dictionary]]

--
1. Something that a copy can be based on because it is an extremely good example of its type

2. A person who wears clothes so that they can be photographed or shown to possible buyers, or a person who is employed to be photographed or painted

3. A particular type of machine, especially a car, that is slightly different from machines of the same type

4. Something that represents another thing, either as a physical object that is usually smaller than the real object, or as a simple description that can be used in calculations.

## Models can be used for different purposes...*


1. Synthesize existing knowledge

2. Forecast future conditions

3. Examine the fundamental behavior of a system

4. Identify gaps in current knowledge and guide future research

5. Generate hypotheses

Try to describe the ley elements and links of a complex system

.footnote[Eisenack et al. (2006)]]

.pull-right[![](img/u1l2/posneg.png)
- Focus on links
- Do not allow to estimate or predict numerically
- Useful to identify bottlenecks, research needs
- Impossible to validate

Relate the current distribution of species and ecosystems to climate variables and derive quantitative relationships

.pull-left[![](img/u1l2/qualitative_models.png)
.left[.footnote[Eisenack et al. (2006)]]]

.pull-right[![](img/u1l2/posneg.png)
- Focus on prediction
- Low predictive capacity when extrapolated
- Often do not consider mixed forests or species interactions

# (2) Based on the mathematical approach

based on ecophysiology, represents key processes (e.g. photosynthesis, hydrology), often for understanding and exploring system behavior

- Focus on understanding
- Sensitive to novel situations
- Difficult to parameterize
- Often not useful for operational decision

# (2) Based on the mathematical approach
##Agent-based models
simulate the actions of autonomous agents in order to assess their effects on the system as a whole. They combine elements of game theory, complex systems, etc.

##Hybrid (population models)
####individual-based models in which agents can't move (trees) combine elements of mechanistic models with empirical constraints (e.g. on growth, tree size, mortality) to ensure usefulness for operational decisions

- Understanding/predicting
- Useful for operational decision
- Somewhat easier to parameterize
