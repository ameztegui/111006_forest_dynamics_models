# Physiological, mechanistic or process-based models

# What is an eco-physiological model?

## *also called physiological, mechanistic or process-based 

1. Ecophysiology is the study of how the environment, both physical and biological, interacts with the physiology of an organism.

2. PB models usually go one step further and try to relate physiology with some measure of performance (growth, biomass, etc.)

# Why haven’t they been more used?

.left[.footnote[From Landsberg, 2003]]

1. Foresters tend to be **practical people**, and those who manage forests for wood production usually want models that provide them with **information of practical value**

2. These requirements are **generally met by empirical growth and yield models**, based on measurements made on sample plots. Empirical models have served foresters well.

3. However, empirical models are generally site-specific and often depend on the logically circular concept of site index. Models based on measurements **lack flexibility** and the capacity to simulate the results of **environmental stresses**

4. Foresters have tended to consider the details of tree physiology **irrelevant** to forest management, and physiologically-based (process) models as entirely different and completely separate from the familiar empirical growth models.

# Why haven’t they been more used? (2)

.left[.footnote[From Landsberg, 2003]]
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Very few forestry schools provide more than cursory background courses in **tree physiology**, and even fewer, if any, provide courses in physiological, **process-based modelling.** 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to acknowledge that process-based models have not, in most cases, produced **outputs that have been of any interest** to foresters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have also, in many cases, been **published in journals** that are not likely to be on the reading lists of those concerned with management.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

####.center[**But there is an increased interest by managers on mechanistic models and an increase acknowledgement by modellers on the need to provide output valuable for forest management**]
