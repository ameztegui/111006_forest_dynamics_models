# Model 3-PG: Introduction
</br>
- A tree growth model based on Physiological Principles that Predict Growth

- Bridges gap between mensuration-based growth & yield models and process-based, C-balance models 

- Provides dynamic predictions of biomass pools, stand attributes, stocking and soil water usage

- Applicable under changing conditions, "at the edges",  and to novel situations

- Maintains an admirable level of simplicity (at least reasonable)

.pull-left[
### Advantages
- based on wide range of conditions
- applicable under changing conditions,*at the edges*, to novel situations
- provides explanation, aids understanding


### Disadvantages
- not as widely understood as empirical growth models
- not necessarily as accurate, either
- can require data not readily available
- not suitable for mixed forests
- works better with even-aged forests]

- **Production of biomass:** environmental modification of light use efficiency; constant ratio of NPP to GPP

- **Biomass allocation:** affected by growing conditions and tree size

- **Stem mortality:** probability of death; self-thinning

- **Soil water balance:** single soil layer model; evapo-transpiration determined from Penman-Monteith equation

- **Stand properties:** from biomass pools and assumptions about specific leaf area, branch+bark fraction, and wood density

# Production: Net Primary Production (NPP)

.pull-left[- 3-PG assumes constant fraction (Y = 0.47) of GPP is lost as construction and maintenance respiration

- Net primary production is then
$$P_n = YP_g = \epsilon Y(1-e^{-kL})Q_o$$

- $Y$ probably varies seasonally with temperature
    - this would be an issue for a daily version of 3-PG

# Allocation: Biomass partitioning

# Allocation: Biomass partitioning

NPP is paritioned into biomass pools (tDM·ha-1)
- foliage $W_F$
- aboveground woody tissue $W_S$
- roots $W_R$

Partitioning rates ( $\eta_F, \eta_R, \eta_S$) depend on site & growth conditions, and also on stand DBH

Litter-fall ( $\gamma_F$) and root-turnover ( $\gamma_R$)
 als taken into account.
 
Thus:

$$\Delta W_F = \eta_F P_n - \gamma_F W_F$$
$$\Delta W_R = \eta_R P_n - \gamma_R W_R$$
$$\Delta W_S = \eta_S P_n $$

.center[Dynamic changes in allocation typically observed in thinning or pruning responses are not reproduced because allocation depends on tree size]

# Root allocation

Root allocation affected by growth conditions and by soil fertility

.pull-left[
$$\eta_R = \frac{\eta_{Rx}·\eta_{Rn}}{\eta_{Rn}+(\eta_{Rx}-\eta_{Rn})m\phi}$$
where:

$m = m_o + (1-m_0)FR$

$\eta_{Rx}$ = root allocation under poor conditions

$\eta_{Rn}$ = root allocation under optimal conditions]

.pull-right[![](img/U4/3pg/3pg_allocation_root.png)]


---

# Foliage and stem allocation

Above-ground allocation is based on foliage:stem partitioning ratio

$$\rho_{FS} = \frac{\eta_F}{\eta_S} = a_pB^{n_p}$$
Increasing DBH decreases foliage allocation and increases stem allocation.

# Litter-fall & root-turnover

**Litter-fall** an age-dependent fraction of foliage biomass

$$\gamma_F(t)=\frac{\gamma_{F_x}\gamma_{F_0}}{\gamma_{F_0} + (\gamma_{F_X}-\gamma_{F_0})e^{-kT}},  k = \frac{1}{t_{\gamma_F}}ln(1+\frac{\gamma_{F_X}}{\gamma_{F_0}})$$

.pull-left[
where:

$\gamma_{F_0}$ = litterfall rate at age 0

$\gamma_{F_X}$ = maximum litterfall rate (may be stress-related)

$t_{\gamma_F}$ = age when $\gamma_F = 0.5(\gamma_{F_0} + \gamma_{F_X})$

**Root turnover** constant fraction of root biomass ( $\gamma_R$ = 0.015 month-1)
