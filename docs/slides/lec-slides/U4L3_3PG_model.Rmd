# Model 3-PG: Introduction

- A tree growth model based on Physiological Principles that Predict Growth
- Bridges gap between mensuration-based growth & yield models and process-based, C-balance models 
- Provides dynamic predictions of biomass pools, stand attributes, stocking and soil water usage
- Applicable under changing conditions, “at the edges”,  and to novel situations
- Maintains an admirable level of simplicity (at least reasonable)

# Comparison with empirical models

.pull-left[
### Advantages
- based on wide range of conditions
- applicable under changing conditions,“at the edges”, to novel situations
- provides explanation, aids understanding

### Disadvantages
- not as widely understood as empirical growth models
- not necessarily as accurate, either
- can require data not readily available
- not suitable for mixed forests
- works better with even-aged forests

# Things to consider about a model

### Temporal and spatial scale
### State variables
A state variable is one of the set of variables that are used to describe the mathematical "state" of a dynamical system. Intuitively, the state of a system describes enough about the system to determine its future behaviour in the absence of any external forces affecting the system

### Inputs
### Data availability
### Outputs
