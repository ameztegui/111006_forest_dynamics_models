2. **Patches are horizontally homogeneous**, i.e. tree position within a patch is not considered. All tree crowns extend horizontally across the entire patch.

# Variations in processes

.pull-extleft[.small[
**GROWTH**
* Different allometric relationships
* Less simplistic allocation
* Competition for light similar to JABOWA
* Competition for other resources generally not included except in physiology-based models 
* Change parabolic temperature effect for asymptotic

**ESTABLISHMENT:** tended to high diversity in each patch and low across patches
* First improvement: seed availability depends on presence of mature trees
* Second improvement: horizontal relationships between patches are considered
* Most still use filters to define n-dimensional regeneration space

**MORTALITY**
* Most models use stochastic “background” mortality
* Stress-related mortality is used in all models, but the definition of “stress” varies
* Clear trend to include disturbance-related mortality: pests, fires, windthrow, **HARVEST!!!!**

# Implications and limitations of gap models

Gap models simulate long-term population dynamics - which are slow – on small patches and with several stochastic processes.

--

1. The stochasticity makes **a single simulation of little interest**. Standard: several runs and statistical treatments (average, median, <u>sd, kurtosis</u>…) --> *less practical*

--

2. **Few data sources to initialize stands** due to the smaller scale of most measurements. Standard practice to initialize from “bare ground” and wait for dynamics to stabilize (~400-800 years). Gap models mostly used to simulate secondary succession --> *less practical*

--

3. This raises the limitation on **climatic data availability** for such long series. 

--

4. **Difficult to validate**, due to limitations in the comparability. No forest will have gone through exactly the same processes (**management!!**). <u>Model evaluation</u> more used than proper validation ->*importance of long-term data!*

--

5. Original models **not valid to assess effects of climate change**. Newer versions are much better, include some physiology->*but number of parameters!!!*
